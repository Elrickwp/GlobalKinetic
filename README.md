THE COIN JAR APP:
After a view trail and errors with the types of RESTful APi technology stacks tou use I have decided on a .Net Core Restfull API create in Visual Studio 2019. Where I followed the Singleton Pattern and Dependency injection by using UNITY for loosely-coupled design.

My implementation uses IMemoryCache caching to save the updated values and discard it after the application has stopped, Although I have also implemented a on disc approach to save the Amount.
I have split my project into numerous assemblies to represent the layers of my application,
I have used Swagger to view and tests endpoints

To Start the app:
When starting debug select CoinJar and not run in IISExpress.
Application will create a cache.txt file in local AppData\Local.

Thank you for the time and opportunity to allow me to do this assessment
